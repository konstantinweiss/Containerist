The Containerist is a structuring and rendering mechanism for building web pages and sites.

## The Containerist Principle

1. A *web page* is a stack of containers.
2. Each container has an *origin* (=URL). It can be included in as many pages and in any order as it is relevant. The container is independent from anything else on any page.
3. The author maintains the container's original content.
4. The author can update the content anytime, and it would update in all the places it is viewable.
The container's content is open to anyone and human and program readable.

## How to use

Still to be documented.
